### How does the service work?

You upload photos of your mushroom, and an expert will review the images and provide an assessment based on visible characteristics.

### How long does it take to get a response?

We aim to respond within 1â€“2 business days. During peak season (e.g., autumn), it may take a little longer.

### How do I log in?

[Log in here](/user/login) if you already have an account. If you don't, you can create one during login.

### Do I need to register?

No. You can submit anonymously, but registered users get access to their history and faster follow-ups.

### What happens after I submit?

You will receive a reference code. When the review is ready, you can use this code to retrieve your response.

### Is the identification 100% accurate?

No. The assessment is based solely on visible features in your photos and should never be the sole basis for consuming mushrooms.
